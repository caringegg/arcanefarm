Just a list of tasks I would like to see in the program


Things I will most likely do: 

- Make compatible versions for Linux and MacOS (i only have a windows, how do i do this bro) partially done on for mac on 1.1.0, still need 1.2.0 mac version

- ~~A lot more error handling messages~~ DONE

- ~~Tells you the name of the channel you will send messages in, during the confirmation screen~~ DONE

Things that will probably not happen but would be cool:

- Can detect when you level up in a server with the and tell you 

- Record a video directing users throughout the process (only if the project gets popular and lets be honest thats not happening)

- GUI interface rather than just a terminal space (this will never happen, i have 0 experience in this)

- Interactive setup while configuring config.ini
