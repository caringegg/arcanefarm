Just a list of tasks I would like to see in the program


Things I will most likely do: 

Make compatible versions for Linux and MacOS (i only have a windows, how do i do this bro)
A lot more error handling messages 
Tells you the name of the channel you will send messages in, during the confirmation screen

Things that will probably not happen but would be cool:

Can detect when you level up in a server with the and tell you
Record a video directing users throughout the process (only if the project gets popular and lets be honest thats not happening)
GUI interface rather than just a terminal space (this will never happen, i have 0 experience in this)
Interactive setup while configuring config.ini
